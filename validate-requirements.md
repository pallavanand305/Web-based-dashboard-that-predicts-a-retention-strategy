# Requirements Validation Checklist

## âœ… High-Level Architecture

### 1. Data Ingestion (Batch)
- [x] CSV upload from UI
- [x] UI â†’ API Gateway â†’ Lambda â†’ DynamoDB flow
- [x] File processing and validation

### 2. Model Scoring  
- [x] UI â†’ API Gateway â†’ Lambda â†’ SNS flow
- [x] Health score prediction model deployed to Lambda
- [x] Top 10 risky customers identification
- [x] Key driver analysis (usage, tickets, payments)

### 3. API Layer
- [x] API Gateway routing to Lambda handlers
- [x] Proper error handling and CORS
- [ ] Authentication (skipped for MVP)

### 4. Frontend
- [x] React SPA on S3 (ready for deployment)
- [x] REST API integration

## âœ… REST API Endpoints

- [x] `GET /scores/latest?segment=&region=&limit=` - Health score distribution
- [x] `GET /customers/{id}/score` - Individual customer risk score
- [x] `GET /customers?agg=true&limit=` - Aggregated customer scoring
- [x] `POST /ingest/upload-url` - CSV upload URL generation

## âœ… React SPA Components

### DashboardPage
- [x] Health score distribution visualization (bar chart)
- [x] Risk score distribution (pie chart)
- [x] Top 5 risky customers table
- [x] Key factor identification
- [x] Equal weightage scoring

### UploadData
- [x] Guided CSV upload
